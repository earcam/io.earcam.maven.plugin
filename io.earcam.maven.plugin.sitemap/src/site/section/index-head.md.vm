${h3} Features

* Create sitemaps (and sitemap indices) for your maven generated site 
* Submit sitemaps to any engine (run independently as a  post site-deploy goal)
* Fully compliant with the [sitemaps.org][sitemaps-org] specification (XML format)
* Scales well for large sites (streams everything, accumulates only listings of generated files (held per module, then cached to filesystem)) 

<!--
argh!   TODO
	* Create permissive [`robots.txt`][robotstxt-org] linking to the sitemap

${h3} Scenarios

${h4} Single module project

0. Generates a `sitemap.xml` file, or if the contents exceeds the maximums (50mb in uncompressed size or 50k entries), then it is split into multiple files
0. Where multiple `sitemap.xml` files are generated, then a `sitemapindex.xml` file is also generated
0. Should the `sitemapindex.xml` file exceed the same maximums it is also split

${h4} Multi-module projects

Per module the process is the same as for a single module project.  The exception is the root project, which performs the following:

0. Generates a `sitemap.xml` file, or if the contents exceeds the maximums (50mb in uncompressed size or 50k entries), then it is split into multiple files
0. Generates a `sitemapindex.xml` file for all known `sitemap.xml` files in self and child modules  
0. Should the `sitemapindex.xml` file exceed the same maximums it is also split
